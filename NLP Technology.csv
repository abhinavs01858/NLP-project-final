Premature death by alcohol being far more preferable.,,,,,,,,O,J
"I seem to recall that the Soviet Union (and the whole of the Eastern bloc) had astonishing problems with alcohol\n\nYou recall wrong. Russia, Ukraine, Belarus etc. have terrible problems with alcohol abuse which the USSR didn't have.\nHaving said which, alcoholism and alcohol consumption in general have been falling in this country for decades so if neo-liberalism is a factor, it's a positive one (possibly due to the way it reduces our disposable income).",,,,,,,,F,

"When I lived in a small town on France, there was a road where the sculptor Arisitide Maillol used to live called Rue Aristide Maillol. I always thought that was brilliant - imagine getting into a taxi so drunk that you can't remember you live but you can just about remember your name.",,,,,,,,F,

"I see people staggering in piss-stained jeans, people with dried blood on their t-shirts, people puking down lamp posts, people in handcuffs, people bellowing and throwing bottles down a quiet residential street at three a.m. and wonder. Is that what 'having fun' looks like in the twenty-first century?",,,,,,,,O,J
No need to stay up late. You'll see most of this and more in Leeds before it even gets dark. There's a mobile A&E unit on the main shopping street at weekends \u2013 that's a good place to see the show. I once saw a woman having a fight with three policemen outside Debenhams and the shop was still open.,,,,,,,,O,R

"I spent the first five minutes of The Catch entranced by Mireille Enos, and gleeful because she's so very watchable and, excepting World War Z, I've not seen her on TV since Big Love. Then it all began to unravel. Either she was acting over a bad dose of flu, or she'd been told to channel Meredith Grey, all husky little girl voice and mannerisms. Then her character made a string of highly unconvincing and spectacularly bad decisions in an attempt to preserve a glossy veneer of control - yes, it's Olivia Pope. Tottering further into her broken-into apartment on high heels - rather than taking them off or calling for help - was the final straw. That I can't remember her character name is not a good sign. I fear Shondaland is becoming a victim of its own success, as everything starts to feel recycled. I'll try one more episode though, because - Mireille Enos!",,,,,,,,O,J
Well what we do know it that alcohol is a very effective purge,,,,,,,,O,J

"The landlord started talking about selling more than a year ago (when they were doing the garden). He also put the rent up a bit, but it was quite low, so the increase was reasonable. He's now decided not to sell, things seem OK. The work was not major cost (some paint shared between 4 or 5 and the garden from seeds, cuttings etc.) \nIt's always a little unstable though. They've been lucky so far. One of their sharers moved out, and was a year before she discovered the couple already among the people there who gave her a room were making \u00a3100.00 plus off her a month so they could live cheaper! She luckily was able to move back recently, when another one left! So swings and roundabouts.",,,,,,,,O,
"How do you work that out? No one is doing any favours. The landlord provides the service and the tenant uses it. It's mutual benefit. The same as the restaurant. Bad landlords lose their customers just like bad restaurants lose them. Not everyone wants to buy property for various reasons. One being that they are only in a district for a short time or they haven't enough money or they simply don't want the responsibility. I spent years renting property. It's no big deal and much cheaper in the short run then buying. I now own property but it ties you down, sometimes is difficult to sell and often can get you into debt. These things aren't so simple and landlords provide a useful service.",,,,,,,,O,J
"So if you go to a restaurant and pay a fortune for shit food and shit service you should still be grateful because you're having your dinner cooked for you? Ultimately the relationship between landlord and tenant is that of service provider and customer. The tenant is doing you a favour by paying for the service you provide, not the other way round. As for bad tenants, they are a fact of life if you're a landlord. Always have been, always will be. If you can't accept that, don't be a landlord.",,,,,,,,O,A
"To be fair, if the tenant is prepared to spend their own time and money putting up fluorescent wallpaper then it would indicate that they are intending to stay for a long time. It's probably worth letting them do it. Cheaper to put that right once they've moved out than it is to have a high turnover of tenants.",,,,,,,,O,A
"Presumably the previous tenants had been charged for each hook left there. Reminds me of the first house my wife and I rented - listed on the inventory, to our amusement was 'full length mirror - broken' and sure enough there it was in the bedroom. We happened to know the previous tenant and mentioned it to him. It turned out that he'd accidentally broken it when moving out and had been charged \u00a375 for its replacement. I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall when he went to the letting agent to get his money back.",,,,,,,,O,R
Now your daughter has put all that work in she's almost certainly increased the rental value of the house. The fence may not be the only thing the landlord puts up.,,,,,,,,O,R
"Not so much 'can't be bothered' as simply 'can't' most landlords won't even allow you to bang in a nail to put a picture up, let alone put up a shelf or and like that. Some will allow it but insist that the hole is filled and painted when you move out. The landlord will conveniently forget what paint was used, so you end up having to redecorate the whole room at your expense. Landlord claims that your paint job is not up to scratch and withholds \u00a3200 of the deposit as he'll have to do it again. When you go back to the house a few months later to pick up any post the new tenant invites you in and you notice the living room paint job is exactly as you left it. Landlord has had living room decorated for free and a \u00a3200 cash bonus. That's what happened to me anyway.",,,,,,,,O,R
" Right to buy has removed so many homes from the social housing register. What happens once they are acquired (at a bargain price)?. Where are the stats on the capitalisation on that paper windfall, taking the money and running, leaving the rent to go through the roof? Plenty of anecotal evidence though.",,,,,,,,O,J
"Without paying deposits, a mantra of 'homes you and your family are proud to live in' and security of tenure, no, tenants do not move out unless needs change or they are spectacularly stupid and get evicted due to breaking their tenancy agreement albeit with lots of chances to make good before that happens. When you consider private rented homes it sounds to good to be true. What a mess we're getting into now.",,,,,,,,O,J
"Oh dear, typical lefty. Classic. If you think a home is ever going to be in the grasp of the vast majority of young people you are severely mistaken, let alone getting enough together to get a second house to rent out. It was a one-off equaliser that let some people cross the wealth gap while simultaneously widening it as the increased competition for houses pushed prices up. BTL mortgages are lovely for the owners - buy a house and then get some other people to pay off the mortgage instead of getting their own home like they could if house prices weren't so high. I'm not even suggesting they should be banned and I'm certainly not going to call for a string of administrative hoops to jump through - I'm simply suggesting that the rules should at least be fairer and if people won't maintain a decent property of their own volition it should be much easier to punish them for it. All of this is generally a very complex issue and there are many external factors which affect it, but I do believe that everyone has the right to be able to afford to own their own home on a reasonable income and that should come above the right of others to have the freedom to buy as many homes as they want and make a profit off them. Again, this whole business it incredibly complex and I certainly don't have the solution for it without some kind of direct and authoritarian governmental intervention and I wouldn't trust the Tories or Labour, or any of the other parties, not to screw it up completely. Probably the solution is to encourage and subsidise the building of properties specifically for people to buy to live in and do things like help young people save up for a deposit rather than hound landlords to sell up. Maybe provide a better base of council housing to try and put some brakes on rising rent prices and stop the ridiculous situation of so much of our tax money being spent on private rental properties for people on housing support.",,,,,,,,O,A

Yes they are providing a service. They provide investment so that new properties can be built. If the properties are not available to be let then people will not be able to have anywhere to live. This happened in the sixties ans seventies when too much regulation discouraged people from renting out.,,,,,,,,O,R
"They're not 'providing a service', they're hoarding a limited resource (property) and ransoming it out to the unfortunate people who don't have their own property. If your point is that a lot of people are greedy scumbags and that the only way to get them to lift a finger that doesn't help themselves is to increase regulation then I agree. I would like to see regulations strict enough that anybody who isn't completely serious about being a good landlord will be put off ideally but we have a culture where any clown with some money available can buy a house and then rent it with absolute minimum effort.",,,,,,,,O,R
"all the young uns have a degree in media studies or some other nonsense\n\nThat will be nonsense about one of the largest sectors in the world. So, in 2016 it would be better for someone to do an apprenticeship in an area of manufacturing - which as we know is really booming right now, especially in the heavy industries - than it would to learn about something that a few billion people engage with everyday (yourself included) and continues to grow?\nI didn't study media myself, but I understand how vitally important it is that we have a strong knowledge base in that area.",,,,,,,,O,R
"Nowadays, people are left waiting months or years for major repairs like front door locks or broken windows. Minor work doesn't get done. And most tenants are too afraid to do the work anyway, because they can be evicted for it.\n\nEven as a cold-hearted landlord I agree this is bang out of order. It's self-defeating as well, it just makes the inevitable repairs even more pricey when they do get done. In my view local authorities just don't have the resources to police it properly so some of the dodgier landlords can do what they like.",,,,,,,,O,J
"Not at all. It may seem strange to you but one doesn't have to necessarily call for a socialist revolution to criticise the predatory buy to let culture which is rapidly raising property prices to unsustainable levels while simultaneously causing the consolidation of wealth and property into the hands of the already wealthy. They are a leading drain on our economy - if rents were cheaper or buying was more of an option to anyone not quite well off then young people (and other renters) would be able to go out and spend money rather than sit in with netflix all the time. At the same time, unless it's really bad landlords are not really punished for dragging their heels with repairs and maintenance as long as they do it once they've been ordered to, so it's in their best interests to just make it as difficult as legally possible for tenants to actually contact them and ask for repairs. It gets an extra few months, or even years, out of an appliance, furnishing or decoration so the savings will add up for them over the years.",,,,,,,,O,R
"Oh wow! This really is news isn't it! Under 30's spending a whole 32% less on DIY each yeah, that's a huge change! Oh hang on what that actually means is they were spending 158quid And now they are spending 108quid in a whole YEAR. They really have never spent much on DIY have they, maybe they now spend the 50 quid on broadband services and TV channels which simply didn't exist in 1996?",,,,,,,,O,R
"From a landlord's perspective (not BTL in my case) I can understand the no holes policy, like the article says the average tenant has no idea how to do this stuff properly.

Getting a tradesman to do it would be very expensive. I don't really agree with the no-paint policy though, as long as the property were put back to its original state afterwards it would be fine by me.

"Your partner's daughter is entitled to want to have a meal on her birthday with her parents, her partner and no one else. Whilst I understand why that might be difficult, it will be far easier for all to find a way to navigate through this time if everyone can be as understanding as possible to the others' positions. As the \""new woman\"", unfortunately, you are automatically \""the bag guy\"". As unfair as that may be, it will be far easier for you to later assert that you are being treated unfairly if you can demonstrate that you have provided ample opportunity for your partner to spend time alone with his family. His daughter may be being immature, but there may also be good reasons for her wanting to eat with her parents and not you. Perhaps she has big news she would rather divulge to them first, or perhaps she needs to discuss something delicate/sensitive. It is not as if she has excluded you from a huge event (or has she?)\nAs an (adult) child of divorced parents, my siblings and I have made our father's new partner welcome at every occasion. One of those, however, was inappropriate (scattering our beloved's mother's ashes) and not out of choice: our father made it clear that he would not be prepared to attend without her. That was hurtful and took some getting over. That has happened, however, and we have found a way around any awkwardness. A birthday meal is not worth creating tension over. If you can show that you can give your partner's daughter(s) space and time with their father without you, I have a feeling they will be more inclined to invite you in future. Good luck.",,,,,,,,O,A

Why does a grown woman think it is appropriate to invite her divorced friends to her birthday party, rather than switching to a pattern of seeing them separately, now that they're divorced.

He is only going along to appease these two harridans, who are obviously - to me - still attempting to keep him under the thumb",,,,,,,,O,J

There is a new era happening in familial relationships. The stereotype of the wicked step- mother is very strong among those who had fairy tales read to them. I am not so sure that the reality is not that there are very wicked step sisters in the mix. I married a widower whose wife died more than 5 years before I met him. His daughters told him that he had had a 28 year marriage and 3 kids (one deceased) and why could he not just be satisfied (they were still living at home fully supported at 28 and 22) ?\nThey refused to even meet me. They refused to attend the wedding. They demanded his entire estate while he is still alive. WOW. After almost 3 years of marriage they still refuse to even meet me.

"Wow! I read 'middle-aged' and hardly expected her to be only 37. You really don't like his daughters much, do you? And if you didn't already know the ex and grandparents well, you can hardly blame her for not offering up her birthday celebration as a family 'bonding' session.",,,,,,,,O,J
"My parents divorced very amicably when I was 8 and it was absolutely fine until I was an adult and able to understand the full implications of divorce. I'd say it's got harder with age.

I cannot see how the daughter is at fault here. She chose who she wanted at her birthday meal. The issue is the partner lying about it. And he clearly had cause to lie because of the reaction.\nYou don't have any right to be involved in the daughters life and you also have no right to say your partner cannot speak to or spend time with his ex. Regardless of the age of the daughter they are both still parents and are clearly acting as such.,,,,,,,,O,J
"Perceptions change with time, although technically 37 is middle aged, I don't think most people now consider 37 year olds as 'middle aged'. With people living longer they're putting off the life changing events (like having children etc) to a later age. Being 'middle aged' is more about a state of mind than your actual age, thus the 'mid life crisis'",,,,,,,,O,J
"Abandoning your kids who you've known for 37 yearsWhat an exaggeration. Don't become a counselor.Choosing not to go to one party that by being there can create months of inter family upset is not abandoning someone. What is so significant about a 37 year birthday party that you could not take your daughter to diner, lunch or something else another day, the two of you together. Or are you concerned you might miss out on some jelly and ice cream?",,,,,,,,O,J
"This could have been me writing this 20 years ago. But I was wrong and so is the OP. The daughter wanted her mother there, which is reasonable, and the mother probably wouldn't have been comfortable around the new partner (which is also reasonable), so the daughter invites her mother. Perfectly reasonable. The inference from the OP is that the grown-up daughter wants mummy and daddy back together again, which is laughable, and shows the depths of the OP's insecurities. I think the father is also trying to keep everyone he loves as happy as he can, and that is also reasonable. 20 years ago, I wanted to assert my place in my man's life (I was also much younger than my partner), and it caused nothing but heartache, for everyone. In trying to keep everyone included, my partner ended up lying to me too, which he hated, but it was the lesser of many evils as, to be honest, I was immature and jealous of his previous life. As I came to realise, and is my advice to the OP, it's not all about you. Other people matter too, and ex-families that have decades of history also need to be nurtured.",,,,,,,,O,J
"As for her putting a picture of her mother on her Facebook page, I mean, come on, why wouldn't she?\n\nI don't think that's the issue - it's just that the picture proved the partner had been lying about who was present. The partner shouldn't have lied, it's as simple as that.",,,,,,,,O,J
nI don't take offense at the behaviour of the daughter. But it is pretty bad behaviour of her partner to lie.,,,,,,,,O,J
"As the daughter of divorced parents, i understand how incredibly difficult it is to make both your parents happy and having to deal with the breakdown of their relationship without it damaging your relationship with each parent. I would suggest this lady tries to put herself in her partners daughters shoes and try and see it all from her point of view, its one night a year and a small sacrifice for the greater good.",,,,,,,,O,A
"What about the pain that the daughter causes her father by excluding his life-partner? He is stuck in the middle. Throughout this the root cause is often the first wife's refusal to grant her children permission to accept the newcomer. The child is also stuck in the middle. The first wife uses her power over the children as a weapon against her ex-husband, and the new wife feels the brunt of it.",,,,,,,,O,J
"Boyfreinds and Girlfreinds can upset the inner-circle vibe for the most part and if you werea little lesscontrolling you would understand that.

"It is her own birthday, the daughter is entitled to invite whomever she pleases.\""\nPeople keep saying this, but this isn't the way the social world works. If a couple are in a long-term relationship, you invite them both to events of this sort or risk losing their friendship. Nobody I know thinks to themselves \""I really don't like Mary's husband, so, *because it's my birthday*, I nave the right to invite her but not him to dinner.",,,,,,,,O,J

" My parents got together at 19 and stayed together until my father's death a few years ago, so I don't have a personal issue with divorce. I do have a long interest in people. And it fascinates me the entitlement issues divorced children especially have about their parents. If the OPs partner were not the father but simply a friend, then excluding his partner would be an absolute social faux pas. His partner is entitled to consideration. But because the stepchild has daddy issues, the OP is being treated poorly. And partner is playing right into them. It's a fascinating dynamic - no one grows up and becomes independent and have to deal with each other as people rather than roles. And poor OP, who I do feel sorry for, has to sit there and try not to take it personally. Stop shrieking at the screen and seriously, grow up. Throwing insults at strangers makes you seem a little childish.",,,,,,,,O,A

"I was once talking to a very reknowned therapist, she told me that she (and her husband) at times invite all their grown children over without their families and partners. Because it creates a certain dynamic and intimacy that is not there when they do bring them along. I really cannot see anything wrong with that. My husband occasionally goes to dinner/ lunch with his mother (and siblings) alone as well. I never saw any harm (or disrespect) in that either.

"I'll try to explain.Short explanation: It's about family circles. They, like me, like most, have not only one of them.\nLong explanation:Our vision is different than the \""standard\"". It depends of what you consider as \""your family\"".\nMy kids have two families or, let's say two family circles. They are part of my ex-family and part of my new family. Maybe you can regard it, from their point of view, as a big family with two dimensions.Members of the circle of my ex-family are my kids, ex-wife, people of my ex-wife's family, people of my family, old friends, ex-friends, etc. I am not part of that circle anymore. That is the past.\nIn my new family's circle belong my kids from my first marriage again, my daugther (their half-sister), my wife, people from my family, people from my wife's family, old friends, new friends; but, not people from my ex-wife's family. That is the present.\nI think that this concept sounds unconventional for many but, actually, is logical for me. I live in another country now and, have absolutely no contact to my ex-wife and my ex-wife's family. They are not my family.\nMy oldest kid, who lives in the same city ten minutes drive from me, is building a third family circle. He is living together with his partner and, my wife and me don't know very much about her family yet. He has more contact to them and they are starting to be part of his family circle, but they are not part of our family circle yet. If that continues to develop they will be probably part of my family too one day. But, for example, they will probably never be part of my wife's family circle because most of them live in the Caribbean. Who knows? Maybe one day they will make holidays over there, meet each other, have some time together and become part of their \""family circles\"" too. Is that the future?\nFamilies are not just \""This is it!\"".Families develop, change, grow and diminisch, arise and disappear.As time pass by, the question is, Who is your family?\n\""I hope you understand my point of view now\""\nIn the case of the article, the man is putting all together in one pot (one family circle) and stirring it nicely.

"In the first case \""Lady friend\""/very special friend, unless he is a \""Muscle Mary\"". Partner is a word that has been hi-jacked from what was formerly a description of a business relationship and remains so in the US and much of the world, and is often applied to conceal a deviant sexual relationship.

But eventually, I decided to stop fighting it, and one day he walked in and asked ME what was for dinner and things had, somehow, changed. So, take your time. But, above all, make it possible for your partner to tell you the truth. If he's too frightened to tell you the truth because of how you'll react, you're pretty well doomed.",,,,,,,,O,A

"Marriage isn't the first time a partner appears on the scene. From day one we accepted one anothers partners, even though my exhusbands partner was my friend until their affair while I was still married. My kids accepted her too. \nI accepted my dads now wife even though he moved her into the family home the day mum moved out. They had been having an affair. \nWhether divorce is bitter and acrimonious was something no one wanted so we worked hard to get along and move on.",,,,,,,,O,R
"My daughter in turn accepted mine and my ex's partner. Even though until their affair she had been my friend. \nWhether or not, divorce leads to family tension and further disruption was a choice we consciously made a decision about. \nIt was at first very hard and painful, but it now means we all have working relationships. It is good for everyone because there are no undercurrents and difficult decisions when issuing invites. \nIt is not an easy thing to do but it is healthier than avoidance and not moving on. After 4 years, at the age of 37 to be behaving this way is silly. Mum also needs to confront reality. \nMy ex had a affair with my best friend and they then lived together. That was reality and me avoiding that was not going to help my kids or me. So from day 1, we all worked towards a working relationship that would provide security and a comfortable environment for the whole family. \nMy parents had done the same for us. It made my parents divorce easier on us.",,,,,,,,O,R
"nIf the daughter is 37 chances are she had her own life and doesn't really know you if you've been on the scene for less than four years wanting only close family at her birthday is not unreasonable. It doesn't sound from the way you put it that she specifically banned you, just banned everyone who wasn't her parents or partner (not that unreasonable). You leave out a lot of information though does the ex wife have a partner who was excluded as well? (which would probably prove my point). How long have you been with your partner? (if its not long she may feel you are just passing through) or were you the cause of the divorce (in which case why would someone want the cause of her parents marriage breakdown at her birthday?) Whatever the case the headline employs she had a big party and explicitly said you couldn't come when what she did was choose an intimate meal with the people she's closest too a very different thing.",,,,,,,,O,J

As I mentioned, alcohol IN MODERATION relieves stress, which is a major factor in illness of all kinds.

"The Vikings had been resident in the peninsula which was later termed 'Normandy' from 800 A.D.. The initial settlement would have been almost 100% male, as was the pattern elsewhere. Only when the perimeters were secured, would the Vikings have brought their women and children to settle. Most warriors would have taken French women as partners, concubines and slaves. In 911 A.D. Rollo, aka Rolf the Ganger, was granted the territory of Normandy by the French King Charles the Simple, on condition that he serve as a vassal of the King and defend the coastline against further Norse settlement. So by 1066 A.D., the Normans had been resident in Northern France for 266 years, and their leadership had held vassal Duke status (Dux Bellorum) from 911 A.D., inn effect for 155 years.It is difficult to comprehend therefore how you can assert that 'half of the Normans' were Vikings. They may have been descended from Vikings on the male line, but they were well and truly Frenchified on the maternal side! Claiming they were not French is like saying that a person of African descent, whose ancestors settled in London 266 years ago, is not British. The process is the same in every country. You cna't have your cake and eat it. Foreigners who settle in Britain are quickly accepted as British. The equivalent is true for foreigners who settle in any other country, especially when they have been 'resident' there for 266 years! Go to the tomb of William the Conqueror. Read displays of The Bayeux Tapestry. The French know exactly who William was. Only the delusional English think he was one of 'our boys', which makes the local French laugh heartily!",,,,,,,,O,J
"Respirating is also a way of propelling oneself towards inevitable death (although not breathing will hasten the process considerably). I suppose it's worth considering that there are plenty of higher states that can be accessed without taking anything if you exercise willpower, but alcohol is a powerful recreational psychoactive drug that happens to be legal. No doubt cannabis and MDMA give you more bang for your buck with less severe side effects, but safely sourcing good quality gear can be a problem. You can grow your own marijuana easily enough. If you live in the country or are wealthy enough to have a big garden you could also grow poppies and produce your own opium. However, with alcohol, you can walk into any pub and enjoy a well crafted pint, dram etc. with such ease you'd be crazy not to.",,,,,,,,O,A

"This research has long been questioned as it fails to correct for the changing profile of drinking over time.\nThat is, someone who drank to excess for thirty years and quits when told they have months to live becomes a non drinker.\n\""The belief that a glass of wine every now and then will help you live longer appears to be no more than a myth, according to a new study. University of Victoria researchers conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the claim that moderate drinkers (people who have up to two drinks per day) have reduced mortality risk, and found that many of them were flawed. A large part of the problem was how \""abstainers\"" have been defined in these studies.",,,,,,,,F,

"I spent the first five minutes of The Catch entranced by Mireille Enos, and gleeful because she's so very watchable and, excepting World War Z, I've not seen her on TV since Big Love. Then it all began to unravel. Either she was acting over a bad dose of flu, or she'd been told to channel Meredith Grey, all husky little girl voice and mannerisms. Then her character made a string of highly unconvincing and spectacularly bad decisions in an attempt to preserve a glossy veneer of control - yes, it's Olivia Pope. Tottering further into her broken-into apartment on high heels - rather than taking them off or calling for help - was the final straw. That I can't remember her character name is not a good sign. I fear Shondaland is becoming a victim of its own success, as everything starts to feel recycled. I'll try one more episode though, because - Mireille Enos!",,,,,,,,O,J
